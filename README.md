# Wumpus-World-SatSolver-DPLL

The Wumpus world ( Link : https://www.javatpoint.com/the-wumpus-world-in-artificial-intelligence ) is a simple world example to illustrate the worth of a knowledge-based agent and to represent knowledge representation. 
It was inspired by a video game Hunt the Wumpus by Gregory Yob in 1973. 

The knoweldge based agent in this program is implemented using the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland ( DPLL ) algorithm. 

The program prompts the user to specify the coordinates of the pit and the wumpus and provides a way to safely reach the exit.
